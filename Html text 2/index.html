      <a href="#">Back in December 2014</a>, we announced the IFRAME sandbox mode for HtmlService which has <br>
      helped improve the speed of an application’s user interface (UI). It also gives users a choice of using <br>
      a variety of JS libraries on the client. We have been working hard to improve IFRAME sandbox <br>
      mode and have added many features since then, including: Firefox support, file uploads, top <br>
      navigation support, and improved Google Picker API support. Since IFRAME sandbox provides <br>
      faster UIs and has more capabilities than NATIVE and EMULATED modes, developers should only <br>
      be using IFRAME sandbox mode moving forward.<br>
      As of today, both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in HtmlService are deprecated. Over the next <br>
      few months, we plan on sunsetting both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in stages to give you <br>
      enough time to migrate your scripts.<br>
      We have created a <a href="#">migration guide</a> to help you with this transition. For many scripts, no changes will <br>
      be needed, unless they use a small set of features described in the migration guide. The guide also <br>
      describes a few potential breaking changes. It is important that you review all your scripts that use <br>
      HtmlService to ensure that the switch to IFRAME sandbox mode does not cause them to fail.<br>
      Here’s the timeline:<br>
      In <b>November 2015</b>, all new scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox mode unless <a href="#">NATIVE mode is <br>
      explicitly specified</a>. For example, if you make a copy of an existing script, the new script will use <br>
      IFRAME sandbox mode unless you have explicitly set the sandbox mode to NATIVE.<br>
      In <b>December 2015</b> (see sunset schedule for exact dates), EMULATED mode will be shutdown. Any <br>
      scripts explicitly using EMULATED mode will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
      On <b>April 28th, 2016</b>, all scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox unless you have explicitly <br>
      specified NATIVE mode in your script. For example, if your script has not specified any mode, then <br>
      it will change from using NATIVE mode to IFRAME sandbox mode. Please make sure that your UI <br>
      works well in IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
      On <b>June 30th 2016</b>, NATIVE mode will be shutdown. All scripts explicitly using NATIVE mode <br>
      will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
      While deprecations may at times seem inconvenient, this staged deprecation should ease in the <br>
      migration process. Our goal is to provide a modern and secure environment enabling developers to <br>
      create great apps for their users with Google Apps Script.<br>

      <i>Posted by <a href="#">Wesley Chun</a>, Developer Advocate, Google Apps</i><br>
      Happy Monday! Have you ever been asked by your boss to do something simple (good) but long and <br>
      tedious (bad)? Take for example, the simple task of counting up all of the YouTube views for your <br>
      corporate videos and your competitors’. It doesn’t even have to be your boss. What if you and your <br>
      gamer friends are competing to see whose gameplay clips are garnering the most attention? It’s easy <br>
      to manually track ten videos, but how about 100 or even 1,000? While simple -- you can visit the <br>
      YouTube to grab the view count for each video -- you know the real problem with a task like this is <br>
      that you don’t scale with the amount of content, so it’s better to automate with a simple app instead. <br>
      This is the exact scenario that my colleagues and I set out to address in the latest episode of the <br>
      Launchpad Online, introducing users to a pair of Google developer tools that can help solve this <br>
      particular problem:<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first developer tool covered is the <a href="#">YouTube Data API</a>. You can access it like most <a href="#">modern<br>
      Google APIs</a> from your preferred programming environment using one of the <a href="#">Google APIs Client <br>
      Libraries</a>. However, this type of data generally lives in a spreadsheet, and if you’re using <a href="#">Google <br>
      Sheets</a>, you can instead write the app with <a href="#">Google Apps Script</a>, a JavaScript environment running in <br>
      Google’s cloud that, if authorized, can write that video information to the cells in your Sheet. <br>
      YouTube is just one of the <a href="#">many supported services</a> available to Apps Script developers.<br>
      As with all my <a href="#">Launchpad Online</a> episodes, I walk you through a short code snippet (only eight lines <br>
      this time) that will get you started building your own custom solution. If you’re new to the developer <br>
      series, we share technical content aimed at novice Google developers... current tools with a little bit <br>
      of code to help you launch your next app. Please give us your feedback below and tell us what topics <br>
      you would like to see in future episodes!<br>

      <i>Posted by Brandon Wuest, Software Engineer &amp; Stereoscopic Sightseer</i><br>
      Google Cardboard is bringing virtual reality worldwide. Starting today, the Google Cardboard app is <br>
      available in 39 languages and over 100 countries on both <a href="#">Android</a> and <a href="#">iOS</a> devices. Additionally, the <br>
      <a href="#">Cardboard developer docs</a> are now published in 10 languages to help developers build great VR <br>
      experiences. With more than 15 million installs of <a href="#">Cardboard apps</a> from Google Play, we're excited <br>
      to bring VR to even more people around the world.<br>
    </p>  
    <h3>More Works with Google Cardboard viewers</h3><br>
    <p>  
      Anyone can make their own Cardboard viewer with the open designs <a href="#">ready for download</a>. If you'd <br>
      rather not DIY, choose from the growing family of certified viewers, including the <a href="#">Mattel View-<br>
      Master</a> and <a href="#">Zeiss VR One GX</a>, on sale now.<br>
    </p>
    <img src="glasses.jpg" alt="glasses">
    <h3>Better tools for building</h3><br>
    <p>  
      The <a href="#">Cardboard SDKs</a> for Android and Unity have been updated to address your top two requests: <br>
      drift correction and Unity performance. This update includes a major overhaul of the sensor fusion <br>
      algorithms that integrate the signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer. These improvements <br>
      substantially decrease drift, especially on phones with lower-quality sensors. The <a href="#">Cardboard SDK</a> <br>
      for Unity now supports a fully Unity-native distortion pass. This improves performance by avoiding <br>
      all major plugin overhead, and enables Cardboard apps to work with Metal rendering on iOS and <br>
      multi-threaded rendering on Android. All of this adds up to better VR experiences for your users.<br>
    </p>  
      <h3>More places</h3><br>
    <p>      
      Finally, to help bring you to more places, you can now explore <a href="#">Google Street View</a> in Cardboard. <br>
      So, download the updated Google Street View app for <a href="#">Android</a> or <a href="#">iOS</a>, and grab your Cardboard to <br>
      immerse yourself in destinations around the world.<br>
    </p>
    <img src="phone.png" alt="phone">
    <p>
      With Cardboard available in more places, we're hoping to bring the world just a little bit closer to<br>
      everyone. Happy exploring!<br>

      Have you ever wanted a server API that modifies cells in a Google Sheet, to execute a Google Apps <br>
      Script app from outside of Google Apps, or a way to use Apps Script as an API platform? Today, <br>
      we’re excited to announce you can do all that and more with the Google Apps Script Execution API.<br>
      The Execution API allows developers to execute scripts from any client (browser, server, mobile, or <br>
      any device). You provide the authorization, and the Execution API will run your script. If you’re <br>
      new to Apps Script, it’s simply JavaScript code hosted in the cloud that can access authorized <br>
      Google Apps data using the same technology that powers <a href="#">add-ons</a>. The Execution API extends the <br>
      ability to execute Apps Script code and unlocks the power of Docs, Sheets, Forms, and other <br>
      supported services for developers.<br>
      One of our launch partners, <a href="#">Pear Deck</a>, used the new API to create an interactive presentation tool <br>
      that connects students to teachers by converting slide decks into interactive experiences. Their app <br>
      calls the Execution API to automatically generate a Google Doc customized for each student, so <br>
      everyone gets a personalized set of notes from the presentation. Without the use of Apps Script, their <br>
      app would be limited to using PDFs and other static file types. Check out the video below to see how <br>
      it works.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Bruce McPherson</a>, a <a href="#">Google Developer Expert</a> (GDE) for Google Apps, says: “The Execution API is<br>
      a great tool for enabling what I call ‘incremental transition’ from Microsoft Office (and VBA) to <br>
      Apps (and Apps Script). A mature Office workflow may involve a number of processes currently <br>
      orchestrated by VBA, with data in various formats and locations. It can be a challenge to move an <br>
      entire workload in one step, especially an automated process with many moving parts. This new <br>
      capability enables the migration of data and process in manageable chunks.” You can find some of <br>
      Bruce’s sample migration code using the Execution API <a href="#">here</a>.<br>
      The Google Apps Script Execution API is live and ready for you to use today. To get started, check <br>

      <a href="#">Vulkan</a> is the new generation, open standard API for efficient access to graphics and compute on <br>
      modern GPUs. In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence meets with Shannon Woods, a <br>
      Technical Program Manager in Google’s rendering teams to talk about plumbing code from your app <br>
      down to the GPU!<br>
      Historically mobile apps have used Open GL ES to communicate with the GPU, but the hardware <br>
      and API have evolved separately, impacting efficiency. Vulkan has been designed to organize the <br>
      graphics space in much the same way as the underlying GPU, so it can be more efficient.<br>
      <a href="#">Android will support both Open GL ES and Vulkan</a>, so developers can choose which API is right for <br>
      them — and with Vulkan, precise control over the commands executed by the GPU allows for great <br>
      optimization, as well as parallelization of code.<br>
      We also learn about the famous Utah Teapot, a standard reference object for 3D modellers, and how <br>
      it is found in popular culture -- such as showing up in most animated movies. Have you spotted it?<br>

        Google Calendar API invites users to great experiences

      <i>Posted by Wesley Chun, Developer Advocate, Google Apps</i><br>
      Have you ever booked a dining reservation, plane ticket, hotel room, concert ticket, or seats to the <br>
      game from your favorite app, only to have to exit that booking app to enter the details into your <br>
      calendar? It doesn’t make for a friendly user experience. Why can’t today’s apps do that for you <br>
      automatically?<br>
      In case you missed it the <a href="#">episode 97</a> of <a href="#">#GoogleDev100</a> the other week, I aim to inspire how app <br>
      developers can streamline that process with the help of the Google Calendar API. A short Python <br>
      script, anchored by the following snippet, is illustrated to show developers how easy it is to <br>
      programmatically add calendar events:
    </p>
    <pre>
      CALENDAR = apiclient.discovery.build('calendar', 'v3', 
      http=creds.authorize(Http()))
      GMT_OFF = '-07:00' # PDT/MST/GMT-7
      EVENT = {
          'summary': 'Dinner with friends',
          'start': {'dateTime': '2015-09-18T19:00:00%s' % GMT_OFF},
          'end': {'dateTime': '2015-09-18T22:00:00%s' % GMT_OFF},
          'attendees': [
              {'email': 'friend1@example.com'},
              {'email': 'friend2@example.com'},
          ],
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      For deeper dive into the script, check out <a href="#">the corresponding blogpost</a>. With code like that, your app<br>
      can automatically insert your relevant events into your users’ calendars, saving them the effort of <br>
      manually doing it themselves. One of the surprising aspects is that a limited set of actions, such as <br>
      RSVPing, is even available to non-Google Calendar users. By the way, inserting events is just the <br>
      beginning. Developers can also delete or update events instantly in case that upcoming dinner gets <br>
      pushed back a few weeks. Events can even be repeated with a recurrence rule. Attachments are also <br>
      supported so you can provide your users a PDF of the concert tickets they just booked. Those are <br>
      just some of the things the API is capable of.<br>
      Ready to get started? Much more information, including code samples in Java, PHP, .NET, Android, <br>

      App Indexing helps you get your mobile app found in Google Search. Once your app is indexed, <br>
      mobile users who search for content related to your app can be guided directly to your app, helping <br>
      you to increase your install base and improve user engagement.<br>
      In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence meets with Jennifer Lin from the App Indexing <br>
      team, who demonstrates the possibilities!<br>
      Jennifer shares that Google has indexed over 50 billion deep links into apps, with searches returning <br>
      these links to users, taking them directly into your app. She shares how the <a href="#">Daily Mail newspaper in <br>
      the UK</a> saw a 22% boost in search impressions, and app users spent around 20% more time reading <br>
      and sharing articles when they came in via a deep link from Search. Additionally, <a href="#">Tabelog, a premier <br>
      restaurant review app and site in Japan</a>, saw an increase of 9.6% in page views within their app, and <br>
      a 63% increase in Search impressions after adding their app to the index.<br>
      When searching with Google Search on your phone, if the app is already installed, and has content <br>
      that matches what you’re looking for -- you can be directed straight into the app to get a very rich <br>
      experience. Alternatively, if the app isn’t yet installed, but has matching content, you can be guided <br>
      through an install experience for the app, without losing context, so that when the app launches, <br>
      you’ll go straight to the content you were looking for! Jennifer demos both scenarios using real apps, <br>
      showing how straightforward the user experience is.<br>
      You can learn more about App Indexing, including how to get started on the <a href="#">Google Developers <br>
      App Indexing</a> site. For more information about other Google Search for Developers APIs, check out <br>

                <p>HTML 2.0 was published as IETF <a href="#">RFC 1866</a>. Supplemental <a href="#">RFCs</a> added capabilities:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><span>November 25, 1995</span>:<a href="#">RFC 1867</a>(form-based file upload)</li>

                 <p>HTML 3.2<sup>[15]</sup>was published as a <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group in <span>September 12, 1996</span>.<sup>[16]</sup></p>
                 <p>Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of <a href="#">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags.
                Netscape's <a href="#">blink element</a> and <a href="#">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="#">marquee</a> element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.<sup>[13]</sup>
                A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in <a href="#">MathML.</a>
                     <span>December 18, 1997</span>
                 </p>
                <p>HTML 4.0<sup>[18]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation . It offers three variations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden,</li>
                    <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed,</li>
                    <li>Frameset, in which mostly only <a href="#">frame</a> related elements are allowed.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out
                    Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as <a href="#">deprecated</a> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO
                    8879 – SGML.<sup>[19]</sup></p>
                <span>April 24, 1998</span>
                <p>HTML 4.0<sup>[20]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</p>
                <span>December 24, 1999</span>
                <p>HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last <a href="#">errata</a> were published <span>May 12, 2001</span>.</p>
                <span>May 2000</span>
                <p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[22][23]</sup> ("<a href="#">ISO</a> HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard
                    falls in the domain of the <a href="#">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34</a> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing
                    languages).<sup>[22]</sup></p>
                <p>As of mid-2008, HTML 4.01 and ISO/IEC 15445:2000 were the most recent versions of HTML. Development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.

                <p>HTML5<sup>[24]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation.<sup>[25]</sup></p>

                <p>HTML Tags,<sup>[6]</sup> an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.</p>

                <span>NJune 1993</span>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language<sup>[30]</sup> was published by the <a href="#">IETF</a> IIIR Working Group as an Internet-Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was
                    replaced by a second version<sup>[31]</sup> one month later, followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself<sup>[32]</sup> that finally led to HTML 2.0 in RFC1866</p>
                <span>November 1993</span>
                <p>HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet-Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in May 1994.

                <p>HTML 3.0<sup>[33]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (<span>28 September 1995</span>)<sup>[34]</sup> without further action. It
                    included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures and the display of
                    complex mathematical formulas.<sup>[34]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>W3C began development of its own <a href="#">Arena browser</a> as a <a href="#">test bed</a> for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,<sup>[35][36][37]</sup> but HTML 3.0 did not succeed
                    for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested
                    parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.<sup>[13]</sup> Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different
                    subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.<sup>[13]</sup> (See <a href="#">Browser wars</a>) These included extensions to control
                    stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture,
                    font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be
                    organized."<sup>[13]</sup> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years has commented for example, "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its
                    business on the Web by extending HTML features."<sup>[13]</sup></p>

                <p><a href="#">HTML5</a> was published as a <a href="#">Working Draft</a> (<a href="#">link</a>) by the W3C.<sup>[38]</sup></p>
                <p>Although its syntax closely resembles that of <a href="#">SGML</a>, <a href="#">HTML5</a> has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its
                    own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.<sup>[39]</sup></p>
                <p>2011 HTML5 – Last Call</p>
                <p>On <span>14 February 2011</span>, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In <span>May 2011</span>, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<sup>[40]</sup> In <span>January 2011</span>, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.<sup>[41]</sup></p>
                   <p> <span>2012</span>HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</p>
                <p>In <span>July 2012</span>, WHATWG and <a href="#">W3C</a> decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[42]</sup></p>
                <p>In <span>December 2012</span>, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[43]</sup> The criterion for advancement to <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a> is
                    "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<sup>[44][45]</sup></p>
                <p>2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</p>
                <p>In <span>September 2014</span>, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup>[46]</sup></p>
                <p>On <span>28 October 2014</span>, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<sup>[47]</sup> meaning the specification process is complete.<sup>[48]</sup></p>

                <p>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="#">XML</a> 1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate standard.</p>

<h1>HTML versions timeline[<a href="#">edit</a>]</h1>
November 24, 1995<br>

HTML 2.0 was published as IETF <a href="#">RFC 1866</a>. Supplemental <a href="#">RFCs</a>  added capabilities:
<ul>
    <li>November 25, 1995: <a href="#">RFC 1867</a> (form-based file upload)
    <li>May 1996: <a href="#">RFC 1942</a> (tables)
    <li>August 1996: <a href="#">RFC 1980</a> (client-side image maps)
    <li>January 1997: <a href="#">RFC 2070</a> (<a href="#">internationalization</a>)
</ul>
January 14, 1997<br>
<p>HTML 3.2<sup>[15]</sup> was published as a <a href="#">W3C Recommendation.</a> It was the first version
    developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML
    Working Group in September 12, 1996.<sup>[16]</sup></p>
<p>Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled
    overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of <a href="#">Netscape'</a>s
    visual markup tags. Netscape's <a href="#">blink element</a> and <a href="#">Microsoft</a>'s
    <a href="#">marquee element</a> were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
    <sup>[13]</sup> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized
    until 14 months later in <a href="#">MathML</a>.
    December 18, 1997</p>
HTML 4.0<sup>[18]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation . It offers three variations:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden,
    <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed,
    <li>Frameset, in which mostly only <a href="#">frame</a> related elements are allowed.
</ol>
<p>Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element
    types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features
    by marking them as <a href="#">deprecated</a> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application
    conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<sup>[19]</sup></p>
April 24, 1998<br>
<p>HTML 4.0<sup>[20]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
    December 24, 1999</p>
<p>HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations
    as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published May 12, 2001.</p>
May 2000<br>
<p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[22][23]</sup> ("<a href="#">ISO</a> HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict)
    was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain
    of the <a href="#">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34</a> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 –
    Document description and processing languages).<sup>[22]</sup></p>
<p>As of mid-2008, HTML 4.01 and ISO/IEC 15445:2000 were the most recent versions of HTML. Development
    of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early
    and mid-2000s.</p>
October 28, 2014<br>
<p>HTML5<sup>[24]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation.<sup>[25]</sup></p>

<p>HTML Tags,<sup>[6]</sup> an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
    June 1992</p>
<p>First informal draft of the HTML DTD,<sup>[26]</sup> with seven<sup>[27][28][29]</sup> subse
    quent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)</p>
November 1992<br>
<p>HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather
    than 1.0), an informal draft<sup>[29]</sup>
    June 1993</p>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language<sup>[30]</sup> was published by the <a href="#">IETF</a> IIIR Working Group
    as an Internet-Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a second version<sup>[31]</sup>
    one month later, followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself<sup>[32]</sup> that finally
    led to HTML 2.0 in RFC1866
    November 1993</p>
<p>HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet-Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext
    Markup Language draft. It expired in May 1994.</p>
April 1995 (authored March 1995)<br>
<p>HTML 3.0<sup>[33]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five
    months later (28 September 1995)<sup>[34]</sup> without further action. It included many of
    the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow
    around figures and the display of complex mathematical formulas.<sup>[34]</sup></p>
<p>W3C began development of its own <a href="#">Arena browser</a> as a <a href="#">test bed</a> for
    HTML 3 and Cas cading Style Sheets,<sup>[35][36][37]</sup> but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for
    several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser
    development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the
    IETF.<sup>[13]</sup> Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to
    implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own
    extensions to it.<sup>[13]</sup> (See <a href="#">Browser wars</a>) These included extensions
    to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering
    community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size and font face were
    definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document
    would be organized."<sup>[13]</sup> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years has
    commented for example, "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending
    HTML features."<sup>[13]</sup></p>
<h3>January 2008</h3>
<a href="#">HTML5</a> was published as a <a href="#">Working Draft</a> (<a href="#">link</a>) by
the W3C.<sup>[38]</sup><br>
<p>Although its syntax closely resembles that of <a href="#">SGML</a>, <a href="#">HTML5</a> has
    abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html"
    serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.<sup>[39]</sup></p>
2011 HTML5 – Last Call<br>
<p>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones
    for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities
    inside and
    outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite
    to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for
    recommendation.<sup>[40]</sup>
    In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its
    project to release HTML5.<sup>[41]</sup></p>
2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation<br>
<p>In July 2012, WHATWG and <a href="#">W3C</a> decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue
    the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as
    a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living
    Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being
    updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[42]</sup></p>
<p>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[43]</sup> The criterion
    for advancement to <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a> is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable
    implementations".<sup>[44][45]</sup></p>
2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation<br>
<p>In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup>[46]</sup><br>
<p>On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<sup>[47]</sup> meaning the
    specification process is complete.<sup>[48]</sup></p>
<h2>XHTML versions[<a href="#">edit</a>]</h2>
Main article: <a href="#">XHTML</a><br>
<p>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="#">XML</a>
    1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate standard.</p>
<ul>
    <li>XHTML 1.0,<sup>[49]</sup> published January 26, 2000, as a W3C Recommendation, later
        revised and republished August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML
        4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.
    <li>XHTML 1.1,<sup>[50]</sup> published May 31, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation. It is
        based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, is reformulated
        using modules from <a href="#">Modularization of XHTML</a>, which was published April 10,
        2001, as a W3C Recommendation.
    <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, but work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work
        on <a href="#">HTML5</a> and <a href="#">XHTML5</a>.<sup>[51][52][53]</sup> XHTML 2.0 was
        incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an
        XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.
    <li>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside <a href="#">HTML5</a>
        in the HTML5 draft.<sup>[54]</sup>

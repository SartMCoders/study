    <p>HTML 3.2<sup>[15]</sup> was published as a <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a>. It was the first version developed
        and
        standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group in September 12, 1996.<sup>[16]
        </sup>
        Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among
        various
        proprietary extensions and adopted most of <a href="#">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags. Netscape's
        <a href="#">blink
        element</a> and <a href="#">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="#">marquee element</a> were omitted due to a mutual
        agreement
        between the two companies.<sup>[13]</sup> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not
        standardized
        until 14 months later in <a href="#">MathML</a>.
        <time>December 18, 1997</time><br>
        HTML 4.0<sup>[18]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation . It offers three variations:

        <ol>
            <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden,</li>
            <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed,</li>
            <li>Frameset, in which mostly only <a href="#">frame</a> related elements are allowed.</li>
        </ol>

        Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes,
        but at the
        same
        time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as <a href="#">deprecated</a> in
        favor of style
        sheets. HTML
        4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<sup>[19]</sup>
        <time>April 24, 1998</time><br>
        HTML 4.0<sup>[20]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
        <time>December 24, 1999</time><br>
        HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and
        its last
        <a href="#">errata</a>
        were published <time>May 12, 2001</time>.
        May 2000<br>
        ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[22]</sup><sup>[23]</sup> ("<a href="#">ISO</a> HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was
        published as an ISO/IEC international standard.
        In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the <a href="#">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34</a> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical
        Committee 1,
        Subcommittee
        34 – Document description and processing languages).<sup>[22]</sup>
        As of mid-2008, HTML 4.01 and ISO/IEC 15445:2000 were the most recent versions of HTML. Development of the parallel,
        XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
        <time>October 28, 2014</time><br>
        HTML5<sup>[24]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation.<sup>[25]</sup>

        HTML Tags,<sup>[6]</sup> an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
        June 1992<br>
        First informal draft of the HTML DTD,<sup>[26]</sup> with seven<sup>[27]</sup><sup>[28]</sup><sup>[29]</sup>
        subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18,
        November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)
        November 1992<br>
        HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an
        informal draft<sup>[29]</sup>
        June 1993<br>
        Hypertext Markup Language<sup>[30]</sup> was published by the <a href="#">IETF</a> IIIR Working Group as an
        Internet-Draft (a rough proposal
        for a standard). It was replaced by a second version<sup>[31]</sup> one month later, followed by six further
        drafts
        published by IETF itself<sup>[32]</sup> that finally led to HTML 2.0 in RFC1866
        November 1993<br>
        HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet-Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language
        draft. It expired in May 1994.
        April 1995 (authored March 1995)<br>
        HTML 3.0<sup>[33]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later
        (28 September 1995)
        <sup>[34]</sup> without further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+
        proposal, such as
        support for tables, text flow around figures and the display of complex mathematical formulas.<sup>[34]</sup><br>

        W3C began development of its own <a href="#">Arena browser</a> as a <a href="#">test bed</a> for HTML 3 and
        Cascading Style Sheets,<sup>[35]</sup><sup>[36]</sup><sup>[37]</sup> but
        HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of
        browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.
        <sup>[13]</sup>
        Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's
        draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.<sup>[13]</sup> (See <a href="#">Browser
            wars</a>) These included
        extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering
        community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside
        the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."<sup>[13]</sup>
        Dave
        Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years has commented for example, "To a certain extent, Microsoft
        built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."<sup>[13]</sup></p>

    <h2>January 2008</h2>

    <p><a href="#">HTML5</a> was published as a <a href="#">Working Draft</a> (<a href="#">link</a>) by the W3C.<sup>
        [38]</sup>
        Although its syntax closely resembles that of <a href="#">SGML</a>, <a href="#">HTML5</a> has abandoned any
        attempt to be an SGML application
        and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5
        serialization.<sup>[39]</sup>
        2011 HTML5 – Last Call<br>
        On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In
        May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C
        to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve
        broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.<sup>[40]
        </sup> In
        January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its
        project to release HTML5.<sup>[41]</sup>
        2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation<br>
        In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. <a href="#">W3C</a> will continue the HTML5
        specification work,
        focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization
        will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never
        complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be
        removed.<sup>[42]</sup>
        In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[43]</sup> The criterion for
        advancement to <a href="#">W3C
            Recommendation</a> is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<sup>[44]</sup><sup>[45]</sup>
        2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation
        In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup>[46]</sup>
        On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<sup>[47]</sup> meaning the specification
        process is
        complete.<sup>[48]</sup>

    <h1>XHTML versions[<a href="#">edit</a>]</h1>

    <p>Main article: <a href="#">XHTML</a>
        XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="#">XML</a> 1.0. It is no
        longer being
        developed as a separate standard.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>XHTML 1.0,<sup>[49]</sup> published January 26, 2000, as a W3C Recommendation, later revised and
            republished August
            1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor
            restrictions.</li>
        <li>XHTML 1.1,<sup>[50]</sup> published May 31, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation. It is based on XHTML 1.0
            Strict, but
            includes minor changes, can be customized, is reformulated using modules from <a href="#">Modularization
                of XHTML</a>,
            which was published April 10, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
        <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, but work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on <a href="#">
            HTML5</a> and
            <a href="#">XHTML5</a>.<sup>[51]<sup></sup>[52]</sup><sup>[53]</sup> XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with
            XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately
            characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
        <li>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside <a href="#">HTML5</a> in the HTML5
            draft.<sup>[54]</sup></li>

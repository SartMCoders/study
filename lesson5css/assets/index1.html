<p>Back in <a href="#">December 2014, we announced the IFRAME</a> sandbox mode for HtmlService which has helped improve the speed of an application’s user interface (UI). It also gives users a choice of using a variety of JS libraries on the client. We have been working hard to improve IFRAME sandbox mode and have added many features since then, including: Firefox support, file uploads, top navigation support, and improved Google Picker API support. Since IFRAME sandbox provides faster UIs and has more capabilities than NATIVE and EMULATED modes, developers should only be using IFRAME sandbox mode moving forward.</p>
<p>As of today, both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in HtmlService are deprecated. Over the next few months, we plan on sunsetting both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in stages to give you enough time to migrate your scripts.</p>
<p>We have created a migration guide to help you with this transition. For many scripts, <a href="#"> no changes will be needed</a>, unless they use a small set of features described in the migration guide. The guide also describes a few potential breaking changes. It is important that you review all your scripts that use HtmlService to ensure that the switch to IFRAME sandbox mode does not cause them to fail.</p>
<p>In December 2015 (see sunset schedule for exact dates),  EMULATED m#ode will be shutdown. Any scripts explicitly using EMULATED mode will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.</p>
<p>On June 30th 2016, <a href="#"> NATIVE mode will be shutdown.</a> All scripts explicitly using NATIVE mode will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.</p>

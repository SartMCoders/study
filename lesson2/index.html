    <p>Posted by Saurabh Gupta, Product Manager, Google Apps Script</p>

    <p><a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2014/12/speeding-up-htmlservice.html">Back in December 2014</a>,
        we announced the IFRAME sandbox mode for HtmlService which has
        helped improve the speed of an application’s user interface (UI). It also gives users a choice of using
        a variety of JS libraries on the client. We have been working hard to improve IFRAME sandbox
        mode and have added many features since then, including: Firefox support, file uploads, top
        navigation support, and improved Google Picker API support. Since IFRAME sandbox provides
        faster UIs and has more capabilities than NATIVE and EMULATED modes, developers should only
        be using IFRAME sandbox mode moving forward.</p>


    <p>As of today, both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in HtmlService are deprecated. Over the next
        few months, we plan on sunsetting both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in stages to give you
        enough time to migrate your scripts.</p>

    <p>We have created a <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/migration/iframe?utm_campaign=app%20invites_
    deprication_google_apps_script_101315&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">migration guide</a> to help you with this tra
        nsit
        ion. For many scripts, no changes will
        be needed, unless they use a small set of features described in the migration guide. The guide also
        describes a few potential breaking changes. It is important that you review all your scripts that use
        HtmlService to ensure that the switch to IFRAME sandbox mode does not cause them to fail.
        Here’s the timeline:</p>

    <p>In November 2015, all new scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox mode unless <a href="https://developers.google.c
    om/apps-script/reference/html/sandbox-mode?utm_campaign=app%20invites_deprication_google_apps_script_101315&utm_sour
    ce=gdev&utm_medium=blog">NATIVE mode is
        explicitly specified</a>. For example, if you make a copy of an existing script, the new script will use
        IFRAME sandbox mode unless you have explicitly set the sandbox mode to NATIVE.</p>

    <p>In December 2015 (see <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/sunset?utm_campaign=app%20invites_depric
    ation_google_apps_script_101315&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">sunset schedule</a> for exact dates), EMULATED mode
        will be shutdown. Any
        scripts explicitly using EMULATED mode will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.</p>

    <p>On April 28th, 2016, all scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox unless you have explicitly
        specified NATIVE mode in your script. For example, if your script has not specified any mode, then
        it will change from using NATIVE mode to IFRAME sandbox mode. Please make sure that your UI
        works well in IFRAME sandbox mode.</p>

    <p>On June 30th 2016, NATIVE mode will be shutdown. All scripts explicitly using NATIVE mode
        will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.</p><p>While deprecations may at times seem inconvenient, this staged deprec
        ation should ease in the
        migration process. Our goal is to provide a modern and secure environment enabling developers to
        create great apps for their users with Google Apps Script.</p>

    <p>Happy Monday! Have you ever been asked by your boss to do something simple (good) but long and
        tedious (bad)? Take for example, the simple task of counting up all of the YouTube views for your
        corporate videos and your competitors’. It doesn’t even have to be your boss. What if you and your
        gamer friends are competing to see whose gameplay clips are garnering the most attention? It’s easy
        to manually track ten videos, but how about 100 or even 1,000? While simple -- you can visit the
        YouTube to grab the view count for each video -- you know the real problem with a task like this is
        that you don’t scale with the amount of content, so it’s better to automate with a simple app instead.
        This is the exact scenario that my colleagues and I set out to address in the latest episode of the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILOIxBRPPhgYbuSslr50KVq">Launchpad Online</a>, introdu
        cing users to a pair of Google developer tools that can help solve this
        particular problem:</p>

    <p>The first developer tool covered is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3?utm_campaign=youtube_se

    <p><em>Posted by Brandon Wuest, Software Engineer & Stereoscopic Sightseer</em></p>

    <p>Google Cardboard is bringing virtual reality worldwide. Starting today, the Google Cardboard app is
        available in 39 languages and over 100 countries on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=
        com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go
        ogle-cardboard/id987962261">iOS</a> devices. Additionally, the
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/overview?utm_campaign=cardboard_discussion_cardboard_and_vr_101
        215&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">Cardboard developer docs</a> are now published in 10 languages to help deve
        lopers build great VR experiences. With more than 15 million installs of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/
        apps/collection/promotion_3001527_cardboard_apps">Cardboard apps</a> from Google Play, we're excited to bring VR
        to even more people around the world.</p>

    <h3><strong>More Works with Google Cardboard viewers</strong></h3>

    <p>Anyone can make their own Cardboard viewer with the open designs <a href="http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/man
    ufacturers/">ready for download</a>. If you'd
        rather not DIY, choose from the growing family of <a href="http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/get-cardboard/">
            certified viewers</a>, including the <a href="http://www.view-mast

    <img src="assets/images/image01.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300">

    <h3>Better tools for building</h3>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/developers/">Cardboard SDKs</a> for Android and Unity have been
        updated to address your top two requests:
        drift correction and Unity performance. This update includes a major overhaul of the sensor fusion
        algorithms that integrate the signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer. These improvements
        substantially decrease drift, especially on phones with lower-quality sensors. The <a href="https://developers.g
        oogle.com/cardboard/unity/?utm_campaign=cardboard_discussion_cardboard_and_vr_101215&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=

        5&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">for Unity</a> now supports a fully Unity-native distortion pass. This improves
        performance by avoiding
        all major plugin overhead, and enables Cardboard apps to work with Metal rendering on iOS and
        multi-threaded rendering on Android. All of this adds up to better VR experiences for your users.</p>

    <h3>More places</h3>

    <p>Finally, to help bring you to more places, you can now explore <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/streetview/">
        Google Street View</a> in Cardboard.
        So, download the updated Google Street View app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.g

        treet-view/id904418768">iOS</a>, and grab your Cardboard to
        immerse yourself in destinations around the world.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/image00.png" alt="" width="600" height="410">

    <p>With Cardboard available in more places, we're hoping to bring the world just a little bit closer to
        everyone. Happy exploring!</p>

        Advocate, Google Apps</em></p>

    <p>Have you ever wanted a server API that modifies cells in a Google Sheet, to execute a Google Apps
        Script app from outside of Google Apps, or a way to use Apps Script as an API platform? Today,
        we’re excited to announce you can do all that and more with the Google Apps Script Execution API.
        The Execution API allows developers to execute scripts from any client (browser, server, mobile, or
        any device). You provide the authorization, and the Execution API will run your script. If you’re
        new to Apps Script, it’s simply JavaScript code hosted in the cloud that can access authorized
        Google Apps data using the same technology that powers <a href="http://googleforwork.blogspot.com/2015/03/enhanc
        ed-add-ons-experience-for-Google-Docs-admins-and-developers.html">add-ons</a>. The Execution API extends the
        ability to execute Apps Script code and unlocks the power of Docs, Sheets, Forms, and other
        supported services for developers.</p>

    <p>One of our launch partners, <a href="http://peardeck.com/">Pear Deck</a>, used the new API to create an interacti
        ve presentation tool
        that connects students to teachers by converting slide decks into interactive experiences. Their app
        calls the Execution API to automatically generate a Google Doc customized for each student, so
        everyone gets a personalized set of notes from the presentation. Without the use of Apps Script, their
        app would be limited to using PDFs and other static file types. Check out the video below to see how
        it works.</p>

    <p><a href="http://developers.google.com/experts/people/bruce-mcpherson?utm_campaign=execution-API-924&utm_source=ga
    dbc&utm_medium=blog">Bruce McPherson</a>, a <a href="http://developers.google.com/experts?utm_campaign=execution-API
    -924&utm_source=gadbc&
    utm_medium=blog">Google Developer Expert</a> (GDE) for Google Apps, says: “The Execution API is
        a great tool for enabling what I call ‘incremental transition’ from Microsoft Office (and VBA) to
        Apps (and Apps Script). A mature Office workflow may involve a number of processes currently
        orchestrated by VBA, with data in various formats and locations. It can be a challenge to move an
        entire workload in one step, especially an automated process with many moving parts. This new
        capability enables the migration of data and process in manageable chunks.” You can find some of
        Bruce’s sample migration code using the Execution API <a href="http://ramblings.mcpher.com/Home/excelquirks/goin

    <p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan">Vulkan</a> is the new generation, open standard API for efficient access
        to graphics and compute on
        modern GPUs. In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence meets with Shannon Woods, a
        Technical Program Manager in Google’s rendering teams to talk about plumbing code from your app
        down to the GPU!</p>

    <p>Historically mobile apps have used Open GL ES to communicate with the GPU, but the hardware
        and API have evolved separately, impacting efficiency. Vulkan has been designed to organize the
        graphics space in much the same way as the underlying GPU, so it can be more efficient.</p>

    <p><a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/08/low-overhead-rendering-with-vulkan.html">Android will
        support both Open GL ES and Vulkan</a>, so developers can choose which API is right for
        them — and with Vulkan, precise control over the commands executed by the GPU allows for great
        optimization, as well as parallelization of code.</p>

    <p>We also learn about the famous Utah Teapot, a standard reference object for 3D modellers, and how
        it is found in popular culture -- such as showing up in most animated movies. Have you spotted it?
        Watch this episode for some great guidance from Shannon on what you need to do as a developer to
        prepare for Vulkan, and how using could be of benefit to your apps!</p>

    <p>Yesterday in Amsterdam we kicked off the first ever Polymer Summit, joined live by 800
        developers. We focused on three key themes: Develop, Design and Deploy, giving concrete advice
        on how you can build your web app from start to finish. You can watch a replay of the keynote <a href="https://
        www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVn8tlnwAEs&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICdISJclfQhj2S8QZGjXV8J&index=1">here</a>.</p>

    <p>[Interactive video]</p>

    <p>It has been amazing to see how much the community has grown and how far the project has come:
        what started as an experiment in a new way of developing on the web platform has steadily grown
        into the range of tools, product lines, and community contributions we saw presented throughout the
        Summit. Since Polymer 1.0 launched in May we’ve seen more than 150,000 public facing pages
        created with Polymer.</p>
    <p>In case you missed any of the sessions, we’ve consolidated all of the recordings below:</p>

        API invites users to great experiences</a></h1>

    <p><em>Posted by Wesley Chun, Developer Advocate, Google Apps</em></p>

    <p>Have you ever booked a dining reservation, plane ticket, hotel room, concert ticket, or seats to the
        game from your favorite app, only to have to exit that booking app to enter the details into your
        calendar? It doesn’t make for a friendly user experience. Why can’t today’s apps do that for you
        automatically?</p>

    <p>In case you missed it the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNo9IoZMelI&feature=youtu.be&index=97&list=PLO
    U2XLYxmsIJDPXCTt5TLDu67271PruEk">episode 97</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJDPXCTt5TLDu67
    271PruEk">#GoogleDev100</a> the other week, I aim to inspire how app
        developers can streamline that process with the help of the Google Calendar API. A short Python
        script, anchored by the following snippet, is illustrated to show developers how easy it is to
        programmatically add calendar events:</p>

    <pre>
        CALENDAR = apiclient.discovery.build('calendar', 'v3',
        http=creds.authorize(Http()))
        GMT_OFF = '-07:00' # PDT/MST/GMT-7
        EVENT = {
            'summary': 'Dinner with friends',
            'start': {'dateTime': '2015-09-18T19:00:00%s' % GMT_OFF},
            'end': {'dateTime': '2015-09-18T22:00:00%s' % GMT_OFF},
            'attendees': [
                {'email': 'friend1@example.com'},
                {'email': 'friend2@example.com'},
            ],
        }
    </pre>

    <p>For deeper dive into the script, check out <a href="http://wescpy.blogspot.com/2015/09/creating-events-in-google-
    calendar.html">the corresponding blogpost</a>. With code like that, your app
        can automatically insert your relevant events into your users’ calendars, saving them the effort of
        manually doing it themselves. One of the surprising aspects is that a limited set of actions, such as
        RSVPing, is even available to non-Google Calendar users. By the way, inserting events is just the
        beginning. Developers can also delete or update events instantly in case that upcoming dinner gets
        pushed back a few weeks. Events can even be repeated with a recurrence rule. Attachments are also
        supported so you can provide your users a PDF of the concert tickets they just booked. Those are
        just some of the things the API is capable of.</p>

        Googler: Learn about App Indexing and Search</a></h1>

        Developer Advocate.</em></p>

    <p>App Indexing helps you get your mobile app found in Google Search. Once your app is indexed,
        mobile users who search for content related to your app can be guided directly to your app, helping
        you to increase your install base and improve user engagement.</p>

    <p>In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence meets with Jennifer Lin from the App Indexing
        team, who demonstrates the possibilities!</p>

    <p>Jennifer shares that Google has indexed over 50 billion deep links into apps, with searches returning
        these links to users, taking them directly into your app. She shares how the <a href="https://developers.google.
        com/app-indexing/partners/case-study-daily-mail.pdf">Daily Mail newspaper in
    the UK</a> saw a 22% boost in search impressions, and app users spent around 20% more time reading
        and sharing articles when they came in via a deep link from Search. Additionally, <a href="https://developers.
        google.com/app-indexing/partners/case-study-tabelog.pdf">Tabelog, a premier
        restaurant review app and site in Japan</a>, saw an increase of 9.6% in page views within their app, and
        a 63% increase in Search impressions after adding their app to the index.</p>

    <p>When searching with Google Search on your phone, if the app is already installed, and has content
        that matches what you’re looking for -- you can be directed straight into the app to get a very rich
        experience. Alternatively, if the app isn’t yet installed, but has matching content, you can be guided
        through an install experience for the app, without losing context, so that when the app launches,
        you’ll go straight to the content you were looking for! Jennifer demos both scenarios using real apps,
        showing how straightforward the user experience is.</p>

    <p>You can learn more about App Indexing, including how to get started on the <a href="https://developers.google.com
    /app-indexing/introduction>">Google Developers App Indexing</a> site. For more information

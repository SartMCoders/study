	 	<a href="#">back in December 2014,</a>we</i>announced the IFRAME sandbox mode for HtmlService which has<br>
	 	helped improve the speed of an application’s user interface (UI). It also gives users a choice of using<br>
	 	a variety of JS libraries on the client. We have been working hard to improve IFRAME sandbox<br>
	 	mode and have added many features since then, including: Firefox support, file uploads, top<br>
	 	navigation support, and improved Google Picker API support. Since IFRAME sandbox provides<br>
	 	faster UIs and has more capabilities than NATIVE and EMULATED modes, developers should only<br>
	 	be using IFRAME sandbox mode moving forward.<br>
	 	As of today, both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in HtmlService are deprecated. Over the next<br>
	 	few months, we plan on sunsetting both EMULATED and NATIVE modes in stages to give you<br>  
	 	enough time to migrate your scripts.<br>
	 	We have created a to help you with this transition. For many scripts, no changes will<br>
	 	be needed, unless they use a small set of features described in the migration guide. The guide also<br>
	 	describes a few potential breaking changes. It is important that you review all your scripts that use<br>
	 	HtmlService to ensure that the switch to IFRAME sandbox mode does not cause them to fail.<br>
	 	Here’s the timeline:<br>
	 	In <b>November 2015,</b> <i>all</i> new scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox mode unless<a href="#"> NATIVE mode is<br>explicitly specified.</a>
	 	For example, if you make a copy of an existing script, the new script will use<br>
	 	IFRAME sandbox mode unless you have explicitly set the sandbox mode to NATIVE.<br>
	 	In <b>December 2015</b> <i>(see <a href="#">sunset schedule</a>sunset schedule for exact dates)</i>, EMULATED mode will be shutdown. Any<br>
	 	scripts explicitly using EMULATED mode will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
	 	On <b>April 28th, 2016,</b> <i>all</i> scripts will default to IFRAME sandbox unless you have explicitly<br>
	 	specified NATIVE mode in your script. For example, if your script has not specified any mode, then<br>
	 	it will change from using NATIVE mode to IFRAME sandbox mode. Please make sure that your UI<br>
	 	works well in IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
	 	On <b>June 30th 2016,</b> NATIVE mode will be shutdown. All scripts explicitly using NATIVE mode<br>
	 	will default to IFRAME sandbox mode.<br>
	 	While deprecations may at times seem inconvenient, this staged deprecation should ease in the<br>
	 	migration process. Our goal is to provide a modern and secure environment enabling developers to<br>
	 	create great apps for their users with Google Apps Script.<br>

	   Happy Monday! Have you ever been asked by your boss to do something simple (good) but long and<br>
	   tedious (bad)? Take for example, the simple task of counting up all of the YouTube views for your<br>
	   corporate videos and your competitors’. It doesn’t even have to be your boss. What if you and your<br>
	   gamer friends are competing to see whose gameplay clips are garnering the most attention? It’s easy<br>
	   to manually track ten videos, but how about 100 or even 1,000? While simple -- you can visit the <br>
	   YouTube to grab the view count for each video -- you know the real problem with a task like this is<br>
	   that you don’t scale with the amount of content, so it’s better to automate with a simple app instead.<br>
	   This is the exact scenario that my colleagues and I set out to address in the latest episode of the<br>
	   <a href="#">Launchpad Onlin</a>, introducing users to a pair of Google developer tools that can help solve this
	   particular problem:
	</p>
	<p>
	  The first developer tool covered is the<a href="#">YouTube Data API. </a>You can access it like most<a href="#">modern</a><br>
	  <a href="#">Google APIs</a> from your preferred programming environment using one of the<a href="#">Google APIs Client</a><br>
	  <a href="#">Libraries.</a> However, this type of data generally lives in a spreadsheet, and if you’re using <a href="#">Google <br>Sheets</a>,
	  you can instead write the app with <a href="#">Google Apps Script</a>, a JavaScript environment running in<br>
	  Google’s cloud that, if authorized, can write that video information to the cells in your Sheet.<br>
	  YouTube is just one of the <a href="#">many supported services</a> available to Apps Script developers.

	  Google Cardboard is bringing virtual reality worldwide. Starting today, the Google Cardboard app is<br>
	  available in 39 languages and over 100 countries on both<a href="#">Android</a> and <a href="#">IOS</a> devices. Additionally, the<br>
	  <a href="#">Cardboard developer docs</a> are now published in 10 languages to help developers build great VR<br>
	  experiences. With more than 15 million installs of <a href="#">Cardboard apps</a> from Google Play, we're excited<br>
	  to bring VR to even more people around the world.<br>
	</p>  
	  <h3>More Works with Google Cardboard viewers</h3><br>
	<p> 
		Anyone can make their own Cardboard viewer with the open designs <a href="#">ready for download.</a>If you'd<br>
	  rather not DIY, choose from the growing family of <a href="#">certified viewers,</a> including the certified <a href="#"> Mattel View-<br> Master</a>
	  and <a href="#">Zeiss VR One GX,</a> on sale now.
	</p>
	<img src="image01.jpg" alt="Boris">
	<h3>Better tools for building</h3><br>
	<p>
		The <a href="#">Cardboard SDKs</a> for Android and Unity have been updated to address your top two requests:<br>
	</p> 
	<p>
	    drift correction and Unity performance. This update includes a major overhaul of the sensor fusion<br>
	    algorithms that integrate the signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer. These improvements<br>
	    substantially decrease drift, especially on phones with lower-quality sensors. The <a href="#">Cardboard SDK</a><br>
	    <a href="#">  for Unity</a>now supports a fully Unity-native distortion pass. This improves performance by avoiding<br>
	    all major plugin overhead, and enables Cardboard apps to work with Metal rendering on iOS<br>
	    and multi-threaded rendering on Android. All of this adds up to better VR experiences for your users.<br>
	</p>
	<h3>More places</h3>
	<p>    Finally, to help bring you to more places, you can now explore <a href="#">Google Street View</a> in Cardboard.<br>
	    So, download the updated Google Street View app for <a href="#">Android</a> or <a href="#">Ios</a>, and grab your Cardboard to<br>
	    immerse yourself in destinations around the world.
	</p>

	<p>With Cardboard available in more places, we're hoping to bring the world just a little bit closer to everyone. Happy exploring!<br>

	  Have you ever wanted a server API that modifies cells in a Google Sheet, to execute a Google Apps<br>
	  Script app from outside of Google Apps, or a way to use Apps Script as an API platform? Today,<br>
	  we’re excited to announce you can do all that and more with the Google Apps Script Execution API.<br>
	  The Execution API allows developers to execute scripts from any client (browser, server, mobile, or<br>
	  any device). You provide the authorization, and the Execution API will run your script. If you’re <br>
	  Google Apps data using the same technology that powers<a href="#">add-ons</a> The Execution API extends the<br>
	  ability to execute Apps Script code and unlocks the power of Docs, Sheets, Forms, and other<br>
	  supported services for developers.<br>
	  One of our launch partners, <a href="@">Pear Deck,</a> used the new API to create an interactive presentation tool<br>
	  that connects students to teachers by converting slide decks into interactive experiences. Their app<br>
	  calls the Execution API to automatically generate a Google Doc customized for each student, so<br>
	  everyone gets a personalized set of notes from the presentation. Without the use of Apps Script, their<br>
	  app would be limited to using PDFs and other static file types. Check out the video below to see how<br>
	  it works
	</p>
	<p>
	  <a href="#">Bruce McPherson</a>, a <a href="#">Google Developer Expert</a> (GDE) for Google Apps, says: “The Execution API is<br>
	  a great tool for enabling what I call ‘incremental transition’ from Microsoft Office (and VBA) to<br>
	  Apps (and Apps Script). A mature Office workflow may involve a number of processes currently<br>
	  orchestrated by VBA, with data in various formats and locations. It can be a challenge to move an<br> 
	  entire workload in one step, especially an automated process with many moving parts. This new <br>
	  capability enables the migration of data and process in manageable chunks.” You can find some of<br>
	  Bruce’s sample migration code using the Execution API <a href="#">here.</a><br>

	  Technical Program Manager in Google’s rendering teams to talk about plumbing code from your app<br>
	  down to the GPU!<br>
	  Historically mobile apps have used Open GL ES to communicate with the GPU, but the hardware<br>
	  and API have evolved separately, impacting efficiency. Vulkan has been designed to organize the<br>
	  graphics space in much the same way as the underlying GPU, so it can be more efficient.<br>
	  <a href="#">Android will support both Open GL ES and Vulkan,</a> so developers can choose which API is right for<br>
	  them — and with Vulkan, precise control over the commands executed by the GPU allows for great<br>
	  optimization, as well as parallelization of code.<br>

	  App Indexing helps you get your mobile app found in Google Search. Once your app is indexed,<br>
	  mobile users who search for content related to your app can be guided directly to your app, helping<br>
	  you to increase your install base and improve user engagement.<br>
	  In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence meets with Jennifer Lin from the App Indexing<br>
	  team, who demonstrates the possibilities!<br>
	  Jennifer shares that Google has indexed over 50 billion deep links into apps, with searches returning<br>
	  these links to users, taking them directly into your app. She shares how the<a href="#">Daily Mail newspaper in<br> the UK</a> 
	  saw a 22% boost in search impressions, and app users spent around 20% more time reading<br>
	  and sharing articles when they came in via a deep link from Search. Additionally, <a href="#">Tabelog, a premier</a><br>
	  <a href="#">restaurant review app and site in Japan,</a> saw an increase of 9.6% in page views within their app, and<br>
	  a 63% increase in Search impressions after adding their app to the index.<br>
	  When searching with Google Search on your phone, if the app is already installed, and has content<br>
	  that matches what you’re looking for -- you can be directed straight into the app to get a very rich<br>
	  experience. Alternatively, if the app isn’t yet installed, but has matching content, you can be guided<br>
	  through an install experience for the app, without losing context, so that when the app launches,<br>
	  you’ll go straight to the content you were looking for! Jennifer demos both scenarios using real apps,<br>
	  showing how straightforward the user experience is.
	  You can learn more , including on the <a href="#">Google Developers</a><br>

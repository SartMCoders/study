 	<p>November 24, 1995</p>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<p>HTML 2.0 was published as IETF <a href="#">RFC 1866</a>. Supplemental <a href="#">RFCs</a> added capabilities:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li><p>November 25, 1995: <a href="#">RFC 1867</a> (form-based file upload)</p></li>
 		<li><p>May 1996: <a href="#">RFC 1942</a> (tables)</p></li>
 		<li><p>August 1996: <a href="#">RFC 1980</a> (client-side image maps)</p></li>
 		<li><p>January 1997: <a href="#">RFC 2070</a> (<a href="#">internationalization</a>)</p></li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>
 		January 14, 1997<br>
		HTML 3.2<sup>[15]</sup> was published as a <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the<br> W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group in September 12, 1996.<sup>[16]</sup><br>
		Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted<br> most of <a href="#">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags. Netscape's <a href="#">blink element</a> and <a href="#">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="#">marquee element</a> were omitted due to a mutual agreement<br> between the two companies.<sup>[13]</sup> A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in <a href="#">MathML</a>.<br>
		December 18, 1997<br>
		HTML 4.0<sup>[18]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation . It offers three variations:
 	</p>
 	<ol>
 		<li><p>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden,</p></li>
 		<li><p>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed,</p></li>
 		<li><p>Frameset, in which mostly only <a href="#">frame</a> related elements are allowed.</p></li>
 	</ol>
 	<p>
 		Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out<br> Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO<br>
 		8879 – SGML.<sup>[19]</sup><br>
		April 24, 1998<br>
		HTML 4.0<sup>[20]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.<br>
		December 24, 1999<br>
 		HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published May<br> 12, 2001.
		May 2000<br>
		ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[22][23]</sup> ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard<br>. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing<br> languages).<sup>[22]</sup><br>
		As of mid-2008, HTML 4.01 and ISO/IEC 15445:2000 were the most recent versions of HTML. Development of the parallel, XML-based language<br> XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.<br>
		October 28, 2014<br>
		HTML5<sup>[24]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation.<sup>[25]</sup><br>

    <i>HTML Tags</i>,<sup>[6]</sup> an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.<br>
    June 1992<br>
    First informal draft of the HTML DTD,<sup>[26]</sup> with seven<sup>[27][28][29]</sup> subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19,<br>
    November 20, November 22)<br>
    November 1992<br>
    HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal draft<sup>[29]</sup><br>
    June 1993<br>
    Hypertext Markup Language<sup>[30]</sup> was published by the <a href="#">IETF</a> IIIR Working Group as an Internet­Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was<br>
    replaced by a second version<sup>[31]</sup> one month later, followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself<sup>[32]</sup> that finally led to HTML 2.0 in RFC1866<br>
    November 1993<br>
    HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet­Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in <br>
    May 1994.<br>
    April 1995 (authored March 1995)<br>
    HTML 3.0<sup>[33]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)[34] without further action. It<br>
    included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures and the display of <br>
    complex mathematical formulas.<sup>[34]</sup><br>
    W3C began development of its own <a href="#">Arena browser</a> as a <a href="#">test bed</a> for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,<sup>[35][36][37]</sup> but HTML 3.0 did not succeed <br>
    for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of <br>
    interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.<sup>[13]</sup> Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to <br>
    implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.<sup>[13]</sup> (See <a href="#">Browser wars</a>) These included <br>
    extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text <br>
    color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a <br>
    document would be organized."<sup>[13]</sup> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years has commented for example, "To a certain <br>
    extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."<sup>[13]</sup><br>

  <p>
    <a href="#">HTML5</a> was published as a <a href="#">Working Draft</a> (<a href="#">link</a>) by the W3C.<sup>[38]</sup><br>
    Although its syntax closely resembles that of <a href="#">SGML</a>, <a href="#">HTML5</a> has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined <br>
    its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML­based XHTML5 serialization.<sup>[39]</sup><br>
    2011 HTML5 – Last Call<br>
    On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working <br>
    group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the <br>
    specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the <br>
    target date for recommendation.<sup>[40]</sup> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless <br>
    continues its project to release HTML5.<sup>[41]</sup><br>
    2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation<br>
    In July 2012, WHATWG and <a href="#">W3C</a> decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single <br>
    definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a <br>
    "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be <br>
    added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[42]</sup><br>
    In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[43]</sup> The criterion for advancement to <a href="#">W3C Recommendation</a> is <br>
    "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".<sup>[44][45]</sup><br>
    2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation<br>
    In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup>[46]</sup><br>
    On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,<sup>[47]</sup> meaning the specification process is complete.<sup>[48]</sup><br>

    Main article: <a href="#">XHTML</a>
    XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using <a href="#">XML</a> 1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate 
    standard.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        XHTML 1.0,<sup>[49]</sup> published January 26, 2000, as a W3C Recommendation, later revised and republished August 1, 2002. It offers the <br>
        same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        XHTML 1.1,<sup>[50]</sup> published May 31, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can<br>
        be customized, is reformulated using modules from <a href="#">Modularization of XHTML</a>, which was published April 10, 2001, as a W3C <br>
        Recommendation.<br>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, but work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on <a href="#">HTML5</a> and <a href="#">XHTML5</a>.<sup>[51][52][53]</sup> XHTML 2.0 was<br>
        incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML­inspired new language than an <br>
        update to XHTML 1.x.<br>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside <a href="#">HTML5</a> in the HTML5 draft.<sup>[54]</sup><br>
